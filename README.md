## Problem Statement
To Design a Rule-based Chatbot which interacts with the user about any topic in Hindi

## Running the Chabot

Go to the Lemmatizer Directory. Run the python script. For reference, the list of stop words used is present in the Lemmatizer Directory as a text file

The bot will ask you about the domain you want to converse about. Enter domain in Hindi.
The bot starts scraping data from Wikipedia. Wait for data to get scraped fully.
The data will be stored in the Data directory.
Now go to the Chatbot Directory. Run the python script.
